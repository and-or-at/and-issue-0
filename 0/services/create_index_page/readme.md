# Create Index Page

**TL;DR**

This Service automatically generates /page/index.html

## Summary

Every time a new page is created it needs to be registered. The most conceise way I have found to do so using Ruby Hash Syntax. (found in [data.rb](./data.rb). & as another side note, doesn't have to be parsed like JSON would be had I used data.js or data.json. data.rb remains a Hash which Ruby knows  FTW) This approach saves time by removing the editing of  repetitive HTML.
