<h1>Hello World.</h1>

<p>Data is a digital good which will not last past the Final Day. However, it holds value just as material goods do. </p>

<p>I have an ambition to learn how to keep data safe and secure. I want a system of retrieval to know what data I have. Data is what I am doing right now by writing. I am recording my own thoughts for my own sake. I want to be able to retrieve these thoughts if or when I have them again. I want to review and build upon progress rather than continue to start over.</p>

<p>I write in two primary ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>pen with ink</li>
<li>and markdown.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am now trying to add HTML as the next step in the process. An HTML page is the how I want to share content, rather than social media, PDF, Email, Word Doc, or any other digital avenue.</p>

<h3>Changing things changes things.</h3>

<p>If I am proposing to add a new step to my routine, then how does that impact the others? Where does the time come from to give this new activity the opportunity to develop? And, how does this new activity influence the use of the others. It is like adding a new co-worker to the office. <strong>How will everyone else's lives be impacted.</strong> </p>

<p>How are pen and iAwriter impacted if the next step is an HTML page? I have to believe if I know where my writing is headed, then I am ripe to practice the 4th habit: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>begin with the end in mind. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what is the end.</p>

<h3>I write for a few reasons:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>To think</p>
<em>Writing provides breadcrumbs to a longterm problem.</em></li>
<li><p>To tell </p>
<em>Writing is record of who I am with YHVH.</em></li>
<li><p>To teach </p>
<em>I write to my long distant sons so they know who I am if they are curious. For, if they are not then this time has other benefits. But if they are curious to know about their Father, then I have taken the time to record these real-time pieces of myself. This is who I am. This is more than my father provided. My father has journals but has never engaged into me learning them. That is not intended to sound harsh, but accurate. I do currently know where his written journals are, and while I lived with them - I read some of them. However, the highlight of the last 3 years has been my ability to live with, and get to know my father and mother firsthand. That is what I hope to experience with Oscar and Wells. But if not, then at least they have these writings.</em></li>
<li><p>To task</p>
<em>The previous bullet point is proof enough. I need to stick to a todo list in order to stay on point. I can go deep and wide on most any topic. Writing things down is the same as providing myself with my own boss.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Not all my writing is public. But that is not because I have things to hide. I just feel that society is not as liberal as it wants to pretend it is. Plus, the public part of the Internet is what interests me any. (For example, I could be motivated by cryptography - but I am not). Further, I want to prove to myself <em>and</em> my employer that I have mastered my craft. Most importantly, I want to reach my long distant sons through a text and a link. </p>
