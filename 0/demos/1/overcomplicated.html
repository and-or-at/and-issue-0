<h1>Have we overcomplicated things?</h1>

<p>I wish I could be attributed with the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no shortage of incompetent people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that was Peter Drucker. Regardless, that principal has been forgotten by a few nerds who run the world these days. I'm talking about the Oranges, Goggles, MacroHards, ButtScreens, @Trumps, and all other tech juggernauts of the world. </p>

<p>All of their technology problems are not <em>our</em> problems. You are part of 'our' if you want to be your own boss someday, or already are. The web is an amazing tool because it is powerful and simple. Sadly, the Fat Cat Software Fat Cats have forgotten about that and only care about the skills that can be used for evil and personal gain.</p>

<p>HTML is the New English and if you don't know it, you are sitting near modern day illiteracy. The Internet is here to stay and I want to help make it easy to learn.</p>

<h2>On a personal note</h2>

<p>A few rather. I am supposed to fly to Naples, Florida in 30 hours to finalize my divorce. However, there is a hurricane barreling down. This means a few things. It means that I am not finished the tearing of my family apart. It is not officially official. That means that in some aspects, I have not technically hit rock bottom. I am doing my best to bounce back and hopefully in the right direction. (Am I headed in the right direction?)</p>

<p>Whoa, that is not the direction I meant when I initially wrote this headline. You'll have to forgive me, I am in a bit of an odd emotional state. I wrote about it on a piece of paper. I'm still wondering how those pages will join this web. But believe you me, they will. I wrote nearly 6,000 pages over three years while going through my divorce.</p>

<p>My impending divorce is what gives me the ability to sit here and type. I now have a lot of time on my hands. I won the Time Lottery! And as with all great pieces of wealth, there are costs. </p>

<p>This Web is my attempt to invest some of my time in a creative way of coding when I am tired of the corporate posture. This, what I am doing right now is a skill set (Web Development) that I do not touch during my day. Therefore, it is a completely different activity. Some master piano; I will master the web. I guess that makes me a Web Master ðŸ¤£ </p>

<p>Since Web Mastery is purely a recreational act and the point of this headline is personal, I want to get more personal. My personal note is that I am able to practice anything and toggle everything. </p>

<p>In other wordsâ€¦</p>

<p>I can code, then write, then design, then make videos, then deploy, then edit, then do whatever else I feel in the moment because this is currently how I play as a winner of the Time Lottery. I have this much time to create my own Web. Lit it was before a CMSs and DBs hit the scene. Assholes.</p>

<h2>Back to the point</h2>

<p>I am sorry about that wordy personal note. I tend to do that kind of thing often when I'm able to do so. I can only do that when I feel the freedom to explore who I am without interference. The state of the modern economy and the demand for people who know how to code go hand in hand. Now that we have lost the low education, middle income job â€” we must find the next best thing. That, to me is only possible if search for the next lowest rung on the ladder. Lower the bar, more people will join. </p>

<p>So I think the answer might be to teach people the basic languages and let them edit the income generating text and buttons for themselves. JUST IMAGINE if people were building webpages instead of sending emails all day. Imagine if an email was a link to a webpage someone could edit and deploy themselves with a tool as simple as text-editor, github, and some training.</p>

<h3>Last year's business failureâ€¦</h3>

<p>Imagine a 12 week bootcamp that taught the bare minimum job skills. Plus, it taught those skills because it taught companies how to hire technically trained, entry level, admin assistants how the web works.</p>

<p>The beauty is the math is easy to calculate. </p>

<ul>
<li>Depending on how complicated your product offering is</li>
<li>And the number of customers you have</li>
<li>And how much a Expert Virtual Assistant (EVA) charges an hour $45 hr.</li>
<li>will determine how your modern front line</li>
</ul>

<h2>the back line</h2>

<ul>
<li>create cucumber / QA tests to auto-test the eco-system of webpages which are created by the employees. Each time a page is CRUD, there will be hooks, tests, and other automated tasks that audit the accuracy of a page.</li>
</ul>
