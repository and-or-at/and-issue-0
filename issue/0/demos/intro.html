<h1>This is my web</h1>

<p>Big magazines are forced to follow a common url pattern. (/blog/next/1, or /posts/year/2019). But this magazine is my web. The pages connect as they need too. The words do too. The organization is that these pages are all individually crafted. Why? because I can practice, improve, and start over when I royally mess up.</p>

<p>And is another entry in real time. Regardless of where I want to be, this is where I am. In my personal, professional, relational, spiritual, health, and age reality. All these entries are in real time. If I wanted to have all my entries look the same, or if I simply wanted to write (and not practice coding) then my writing would be more coherant. But I am building And for many more reasons than fame or fortune. In fact, this is not either so I have no user to serve. I get to choose my Master, and I choose YHVH.</p>
