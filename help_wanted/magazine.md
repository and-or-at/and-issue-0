# i am starting a magazine.

I know HTML, CSS, JS
& Ruby, Rake, Gems, OO, TDD
& Animation, Progressive Enhancement
& Sketch, Affinity, Adobe, & Keyshape.

I have lost four children
& two are in heaven
& two are kept from me
& I had to process that with 8000 pages
& maybe this is my PTSD.

I am trying to be a good long distant dad
& I want my sons to fear YHVH
& think critically
& work hard.

I study Torah
& I reject Christianity
& I'm not Jewish
& I am part of Israel.

I am starting my life over
& I've got a few accomplishments
& more failures
& many ideas.

I ask questions
& question comments
& question questions
& criticize critics.

## Why

If you do not already know that all news outlets are owned by fewer than 7 corporations, then I'm surprised you are reading this.

> In the beginning was the Word.
& that Word began for us with Genesis 1:1
& people have lost sound of the Word of God in exchange for gods, idols, and the traditions of man.

Last I checked our country is 17T admitted debt
& are rumored to be 100T in debt
& 1T seconds lasts 32,000 years
& people need ways to engage with modern skills
& HTML is the new English.

The freedom of press is right to print words
& I have some words
& so I will start a newspaper, magazine, blog, or whatever letterpress you like.
& we'll see how long it lasts.
