    <h1>Judo truth</h1>

    <p>Judo is a martial arts style which is known for using the force of the opponent in your favor. That is what I feel that Christianity has done about the truth.</p>

    <p>My grandfather was part of the billy gram style evangelist movement - where I was taught very early that there is judgement coming after death. And that judgement was burning for eternity in fire. There was escape, which was to repeat a magic prayer after the person giving it. I knew that system so well I helped other people pray after me.</p>

    <p>From my current view, salvation by a prayer is the way the dark side used judo practices against the good guys, and has been effective. The part that I believe that is true is judgement. And I also believe fire will be part of it. But I do not believe the solution to escape the fire is to just say a simple prayer and leave it at that. The prayer or the lifestyle after the prayer have nothing to do with reality. They are not part of a culture of truth either. For the text which teaches about eternity, fire, judgement do not speak about a magic prayer. They speak about the God of Heaven and Earth, which christianity does not speak about. The text also teaches about the nationality, culture, and lifestyle who is being saved, and how the saved are supposed to live upon salvation. Those topics are not discussed. Why would the good guys scare us to salvation but then not complete the story. To me, this is a clue that the message was not taught by truth tellers.</p>

    <p>This is how many lies are left alive. The Liars take the parts of truth which they cannot deny. They simply acknowledge and skew. </p>
