  <h1>Here’s what happens when you read the bible.</h1>

<p>You will encounter strange people, places, and things. You will be transported to another culture and time. The first adjustment in your mind is that you need to realize that these stories are real. These stories are based on facts. This is not a book like Harry Potter which, after reading, you simply say ‘cool story’ and leave it alone. This book is telling the truth. You must come to terms with the truth and take it seriously. </p>

<p>Second, you must be ready for what happens upon accepting these words as truth. They will bump up against thoughts and ideas that are opposite with what you read. For we live in a world of lies. These words will stir you if you concentrate on what is being said. You must contrast what the Words say with what you believe.</p>

<p>What happens next is you will come to a fork in the road. Your brain is going to get distracted by something unrelated to what you just read. Or, the words will cause your brain to think about something related. You need to try to avoid going down the path of distraction. You must follow the path where the words are taking you. This is where you begin to see the reality in your own being that these words are pure, true, and supernatural. </p>

<p>These words have the ability to reach deep down in your soul unlike any other words. The question becomes, do you want to travel the path which leads into your soul.</p>

<p>Do you want to know what you really think, believe, and feel? Do you want to heal from wounds and remove lies that keep you a slave? Do you want to live in darkness or light. The bible is a lamp on the path of who you are and where you are headed. </p>

<p>These kinds of activities become appealing after the alerts and alarms of the surface society begin to leave you empty. And mark my words, life on the surface is shallow and empty. When you hunger and thirst for meaning, purpose, identity, and peace - you will find them in the pages of these holy scriptures.</p>

<p>There is a difference between church and school. There is a difference between church and bible reading. I am not talking about visiting a church, small group, book club, or any other social gathering with people who seek. </p>

<p>I am talking about turning your time and attention to silence and solitude. In that place, take a pen, paper, and the bible and leave the screen in the other room. Sit down for 2 hours and go on a journey that will fill your soul the way 2 pieces of deep dish Chicago pizza do the stomach.</p>

<p>You must change if you are going to change. You must make new choices if you are going to change. You must be different if you are going to become different. That begins with realizing that this book is real and everything you see on these screens is suspect. </p>
