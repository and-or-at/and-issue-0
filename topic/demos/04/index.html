# Consumer Easy vs. Producer Easy.

No matter how easy something looks to make, it's always hard.

As a consumer society, we've been taught what to expect when it comes to consumption. Consuming goods and services is easy. Yet, making those things easy, is hard to do.

Writing code is hard to do. There are so many little nuances to make this a reality. That is why the web is slow, ugly, and cookie-cutter. It is hard to do something unique.

Yet, I am trying.

I am trying to do things as minimal as possible. And let the problems organically come to me. Right now, I'm trying to solve a few things;
- how to get pages to load
- url paths
- templates
- writing content

I want the solution to come to me. Because, now, I know what my options include. They include;
- icloud
- markdown
- webpack
- database
- sublime snippets
- html
- css
- javascript

My Goals include:
- ease of writing
- data preservation
- progressive enhancement
- speedy site
- minimal redunancy
- unique website
- a blog of sorts
- sustainable workflow

## Two types of web pages

I think what I need ot realize, is there are two types of web pages. There are the kinds we humans generate, and there are the kind the computers do. The kind of pages humans make are simple and inconsistent. Whereas, Computers, can make complex and consistent pages. Just because I can code by hand does not necessarily mean that I should. What I should do Is create a system that enables me to incorporate my creativity while embracing the strengths of computer on my code. This is the purpose of a site like this, to make me come to these awarenesses organically.

## Complex Design
I think I need to get real about the kinds of things I consider design with HTML & CSS. My first few pages have attempted to be completely free form hippy unique. But there it is actually tedious to reinvent the wheel. Maybe I need to recognize that good design is how I craft a template of a particular page layout. Aka, design components.

## My Data starts here
Regardless of where I might want to get, the reality is my data is a quagmire of many different .html, .txt, .md files. There is currently no data inside a database. Maybe one day.

But my options are as follows: Keep starting over with creating content, or use my old data as practice to figure out how to preserve data. That is the skill people are paying for. I need to learn how to mine my own data.

This should be fun.
