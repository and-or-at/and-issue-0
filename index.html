                Communication is an incredible difficult skill. It requires near
                mastery of many separate topics. Some of which include critical
                thinking, literacy, spelling, confidence, articulation,
                personality, and an ability to make the topic of focus
                interesting.

              <p class="p">
                The main reason I code is to communicate. I want to send
                important messages to important people. Communication is also
                the first step to commerce. I got into all this because I wanted
                to sell more tshirts.

                This site is an experiment in my ability to communicate over the
                web. While there are many optimizations that could occur, I am
                not willing to swap out success for effeciency just yet. You
                see, here I am actually communcating with you, the reader at
                this moment.

              <h2 class="h2">Cache Warning</h2>
              <p class="p">
                So far the only technical issue I have had with this exercise is
                dealing with page caching. It is interesting to see how long a
                dated page can remain on the client even if you want it to be
                refreshed. As a business, I want to make changes and for my
                customers to see the lastest version of the site. At minimum for
                the reason that I just worked NNN hours (or $$$ hours) and I
                want to see an ROI. This gives me another reason why JavaScript
                might be a necessity if I plan to engage in any real commerce.
                If I cannot get around caching with simply HTML and CSS, then
                (unless I can assume my users will clear their cache), I am at a
                disadvantage to be js-free.

              <p class="p">
                This internal conflict you are witnessing in this writing is due
                to a desire to support <a href="">Progressive Enhancement</a>. I
                love the idea and I am attempting to achieve it in it's purest
                form. This means, I simply need to confirm via the googles if I
                can break cache (on gh-pages, for 'free') or if I need to simply
                make the edit in an NGINX file and pay for digital ocean $5 a
                month to break'yo cache!

              <h2 class="h2">To Err is Sublime</h2>
              <p class="p">
                Another example of practice paying off is how much more I am
                leaning on my text editor. I on SublimeText 3 after taking the
                following tour of editors: Text Mate, Sublime Text 2, Ruby Mine,
                Atom, Vim, then Atom again, then Vim again.

              <p class="p">
                I am comfortable writing HTML. I am motivated to do so because
                it is tip of the spear. It is a powerful language. It is a
                language which has the ability to share with you over the web.
                As much as I want to skip the step of writing and managing HTML
                by hand, this is the most comfortable with to manage my data if
                I want to publish it. "publish" is the key word here. because if
                I were only interested in journaling then I would use IaWriter,
                or simply write by hand. I am actively working toward more
                complex distribution and storage methods but currently I do not
                have the complete skill set to publish, protect, and automate
                this process. another way to say it, is I have the muscle memory
                and workflow established for a hand made site, but not so much
                yet for larger initistives. but, if or when I do level up my
                skills then my personal publishing methods may upgrade as welll.

                Coding by hand is also giving me the unexpecrted benefit of
                preparing me for some of the scripting needs of DevOps. I am
                already writing simple Ruby scripts to automate some of my
                tasks. for example, the /page/index.htm is genersted by a
                script.

                Why retire? Well, I bought this domain when I had a family. The
                idea of being a part of a plural group (Woodalls) means family.
                And, well that's a bit to painful for me right now to live in
                the present, as though it were the past.

                I'm a list person. It's my way of taking inventory with an
                index. This is my way of being an extrovert. You see,
                extroversion is a perfectly human thing to do. That is why we
                should value free speech. Sometimes you just need to fucking
                cuss and not get in trouble for doing it! Hence, Freedom of
                Speech! This website is my attempt at extroverting. To letting
                it all hang out there. And we'll see what comes of it. So this

                  The best part of all of this. Is I'm offline. While I am
                  writing this to you, I'm not even connected to the web in any
                  way whatsoever. [](off wifi). That is the true beauty of this
                  frontend productivity. I can speak freely, from anywhere. I
                  don't even need to be connected to the web to do my job. Other
                  than check in occasionally with a 5GB / $50 mo data plan.

                  I need to have the communication ability with a network of

                  able to log off for 5 - 7 days at a time, without a single
                  issue. I want to be able to travel to see Queen in Vegas and
                  return and recover from it. Then, get back to work. That's
                  what the web provides. But the true work is done offline. What
                  you contribute is a collection of tools, assets, and
                  techniques you have mastered to produce something amazing.
                  That
                  <em>something</em> takes time. And you must be able to work
