        <p class="p">I accept the law that we must labor 6 days away. If I must labor, then I want to do it well. To me, that means mastery of all things withing my ability.

            I bought some of Bontaine's variety bar and tried to make a memory of it with my sons. A simple project while we were in the middle of an unneccssry parent evaluation plan during my divorce - which validated me as the good guy.

  <h1 class="h1">What is the meaning of life?</h1>
  <p class="p">In the cult classic book, "Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy" someone asks the question of what is the meaning of life, to the most powerful computer ever made. At least, that is what I can remember of the story. I bought the book twice, actually. The first time, it was stolen along with my backpack when I visited Mexico. The second time, I made it half way through. However, I was a bit distracted with my own war. But I digress. In the book, the answer to all of life's questions is simply the number "42" which is both confusing and one of the many enduring details of the book. I am turning 42 in 29 days. It is no exaggeration when I say that at least the last 5 years of my life have been focused on the same question as the Guide.</p>
  <p class="p">
    The other similarity between myself and that book is that I did find guidance from a book. That book, being the bible. But not the whole bible. At least, not yet. Over the course of 3 years, I have only started reading the bible for myself. I began like I do with any other book - at the beginning.

  <p class="p">
    Last month I drove across country in a moving truck. During the long, straight, and uneventful parts of Kansas I regularly read the 4 letters on my dash: Park, Reverse, Neutral, and Drive.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    I got to thinking that that would make for a great place to plant a trigger thought. Could I teach my sons something valuable that would be remembered anytime they got into a car a drove.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    I want to teach my sons to use their minds to the fullest extent so I wondered about aligning the movements of a car with the movements of the mind. What follows are doodles of a few poster ideas.

    In the beginning was the Word. The word is what separates man

  <div class="date">May 27, 2019</div>
  <p class="p">
    Communication is an incredible difficult skill. It requires near
    mastery of many separate topics. Some of which include critical
    thinking, literacy, spelling, confidence, articulation,
    personality, and an ability to make the topic of focus
    interesting.
  </p>
  <div class="date">May 27, 2019</div>
  <p class="p">
    The main reason I code is to communicate. I want to send
    important messages to important people. Communication is also
    the first step to commerce. I got into all this because I wanted
    to sell more tshirts.
  </p>
  <div class="date">May 27, 2019</div>
  <p class="p">
    This site is an experiment in my ability to communicate over the
    web. While there are many optimizations that could occur, I am
    not willing to swap out success for effeciency just yet. You
    see, here I am actually communcating with you, the reader at
    this moment.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h2">Cache Warning</h2>
  <p class="p">
    So far the only technical issue I have had with this exercise is
    dealing with page caching. It is interesting to see how long a
    dated page can remain on the client even if you want it to be
    refreshed. As a business, I want to make changes and for my
    customers to see the lastest version of the site. At minimum for
    the reason that I just worked NNN hours (or $$$ hours) and I
    want to see an ROI. This gives me another reason why JavaScript
    might be a necessity if I plan to engage in any real commerce.
    If I cannot get around caching with simply HTML and CSS, then
    (unless I can assume my users will clear their cache), I am at a
    disadvantage to be js-free.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    This internal conflict you are witnessing in this writing is due
    to a desire to support <a href="">Progressive Enhancement</a>. I
    love the idea and I am attempting to achieve it in it's purest
    form. This means, I simply need to confirm via the googles if I
    can break cache (on gh-pages, for 'free') or if I need to simply
    make the edit in an NGINX file and pay for digital ocean $5 a
    month to break'yo cache!
  </p>
  <h2 class="h2">To Err is Sublime</h2>
  <p class="p">
    Another example of practice paying off is how much more I am
    leaning on my text editor. I on SublimeText 3 after taking the
    following tour of editors: Text Mate, Sublime Text 2, Ruby Mine,
    Atom, Vim, then Atom again, then Vim again.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    I am comfortable writing HTML. I am motivated to do so because
    it is tip of the spear. It is a powerful language. It is a
    language which has the ability to share with you over the web.
    As much as I want to skip the step of writing and managing HTML
    by hand, this is the most comfortable with to manage my data if
    I want to publish it. "publish" is the key word here. because if
    I were only interested in journaling then I would use IaWriter,
    or simply write by hand. I am actively working toward more
    complex distribution and storage methods but currently I do not
    have the complete skill set to publish, protect, and automate
    this process. another way to say it, is I have the muscle memory
    and workflow established for a hand made site, but not so much
    yet for larger initistives. but, if or when I do level up my
    skills then my personal publishing methods may upgrade as welll.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    Coding by hand is also giving me the unexpecrted benefit of
    preparing me for some of the scripting needs of DevOps. I am
    already writing simple Ruby scripts to automate some of my
    tasks. for example, the /page/index.htm is genersted by a
    script.

      But I have not lost sight of the big picture. This site is
      also an idea that takes the principals of DevOps, and applying
      them to a static site. This site is going to explore at least
      two concepts:

  <h2 class="article-4">
    After 02/2020, I will no longer receive an email from anything
    ending in 'woodalls.me'.

  <div class="date">May 27, 2019</div>
  <p class="p">
    Why retire? Well, I bought this domain when I had a family. The
    idea of being a part of a plural group (Woodalls) means family.
    And, well that's a bit to painful for me right now to live in
    the present, as though it were the past.

    If you wish to remain connected, email Dave before that date.
    dave@woodalls.me will also retire 02/2020.

        I'm a list person. It's my way of taking inventory with an
        index. This is my way of being an extrovert. You see,
        extroversion is a perfectly human thing to do. That is why we
        should value free speech. Sometimes you just need to fucking
        cuss and not get in trouble for doing it! Hence, Freedom of
        Speech! This website is my attempt at extroverting. To letting

            The best part of all of this. Is I'm offline. While I am
            writing this to you, I'm not even connected to the web in any
            way whatsoever. [](off wifi). That is the true beauty of this
            frontend productivity. I can speak freely, from anywhere. I
            don't even need to be connected to the web to do my job. Other
            than check in occasionally with a 5GB / $50 mo data plan.

            I need to have the communication ability with a network of
            people where I can work the way I want to work. I want to be
            able to log off for 5 - 7 days at a time, without a single
            issue. I want to be able to travel to see Queen in Vegas and
            return and recover from it. Then, get back to work. That's
            what the web provides. But the true work is done offline. What
            you contribute is a collection of tools, assets, and
            techniques you have mastered to produce something amazing.
            That
            <em>something</em> takes time. And you must be able to work
            your magic without interruption.
