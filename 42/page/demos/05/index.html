        <p>Dear Grama,</p>

        <p>I heard from dad you just had surgery. I hope your recovery is going well. I truly admire your strength and will to live. I think I inherited that from you. I hope to live to be 100. That might be because I feel my life is just beginning. I endured afflictions for a reason. They have certainly changed who I am all the way to the core. So much so, I wonder how to have a conversation with someone who knew the old me.</p>

        <p>I wanted to write to you sooner. What empowered me to finally do so is that I made new habits. I have since signed off of text message and email. The purpose text messaging serves is not the kind of life I want to live. Technology makes it easy to connect but lacks content worthy of its alarming interruptions. My choices are enabling me to have moments like this one in which I write you a letter; Quiet. Focused. Meaningful. I am satisfied with how I spend my time when it is activities like these. </p>

        <p>Thankfully, my vocation aligns with my aspirations. As a Computer Programmer, my job requires concentration on complex subjects which means I have to turn off alarms during work hours. I see no incentive to turn them back on.</p>

        <p>When I’m not working, I spend the majority of time reading, writing, and thinking. I have much to reconsider. The circumstances of the past five years forced me to change. I have written nearly 4,000 pages journaling my journey. I have scrutinized every voice and authority from my first 40 years to redefine who I am and what I understand life to be. That includes new opinions about the Bible. As late as 37 years old, I held justifications why the Bible should be treated differently than other books. Specifically, I used to believe that it was not necessary to read the Bible in total, from the beginning. But in my desperation I questioned that premise. Then, I reasoned that if I am covered by the blood of Jesus, then I can explore the Bible on my own without consequence. I sought answers on: salvation, love, justice, identity, and peace. Those subjects sell well. In my youth I bought the counterfeit answers (lies) man sold me which kept me from going to God's Word directly. But the solitude of affliction provided a chance to remove man's weeds and plant God’s seeds in my soul. His seeds sprouted and healed the pains of death, grief, and evil. He brought me to life when I took Him at His Word. All His Words! So, if you were to ask me how I'm doing, I'd say I'm doing better than ever.</p>

        <p>Thank you for all the ways you have loved and cared for me over the years. I wish I could reciprocate with my own love and service. Until then, I pray for eternal blessings and revelation over you and Wayne.</p>

        <p>Love,</p>

        <p>Dave</p>
