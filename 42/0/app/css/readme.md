# &CSS

## Part I

A letter from the editor, coder, and man.

What do you spend your freetime doing? I hope if you have a family, they get a majority of it. Children need Fathers. They need Mothers too. Children are a gift from YHVH. If I could, I would be spending my time with my children. But that opportunity is not afforded to me at this moment in time. Thus, I am left wandering the web. I choose to do it by writing, coding, learning, & <i>leveling up</i>.

That means, I spend my time:
- Thinking
- Writing
- Reading
- Coding
- Listening
- Working
- Crying
- Drinking
- tl;dr Thinking & Drinking with some stuff in between.

But I am an optimistic person. And I have reason to be. And this Readme is where you have discovered another place where I am applying my [winnings of the Time Lottery]().

## Part II

I have a need and opportunity to write a CSS framework. I am going to use it on my portfolio project & magazine. It is a pure CSS3 (no compilers), functional approach to writing CSS.

I am going to apply:

- the modern advancements of CSS
- Magazine layout & graphic design
- writing & my opions

There is certainly at least one of those three departments in which you will discover disagreement. And I WELCOME your feedback on any and all you read. As long as your feedback is from a posture of friendship. I have much to learn and would live to listen. Please teach me what I do not know about life, language, & you.
